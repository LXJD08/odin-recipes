    <h1>How to make Jamaican jerk chicken!</h1>
    <img src="img/jerk-chicken.jpg" alt="Picture of a plate full of cooked jerk chicken">
    <p>There are as many takes on jerk chicken in Jamaica as there are cooks on the island, but most share the same method: 
        <em>Chicken is coated in a seasoning mixture dominated by spices and chiles, then grilled.</em> This version comes from Paul Chung, 
        a self-taught cook of Chinese-Jamaican descent who adds unique spin to recipe</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 medium onion, coarsely chopped </li>
        <li>3 medium scallions, chopped </li>
        <li>2 Scotch bonnet chiles, chopped </li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, chopped </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon five-spice powder </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon allspice berries, coarsely ground </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coarsely ground pepper </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme, crumbled</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil </li>
        <li>Two 3 1/2- to 4-pound chickens, quartered </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Prep & Grill!</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a food processor, combine the onion, scallions, chiles, garlic, five-spice powder, allspice, pepper, thyme, 
            nutmeg and salt; process to a coarse paste. With the machine on, add the the soy sauce and oil in a steady stream. 
            Pour the marinade into a large, shallow dish, add the chicken and turn to coat. Cover and <strong>refrigerate overnight</strong>. 
            Bring the chicken to room temperature before proceeding.</li>
        <li>Light a grill. Grill the chicken over a medium-hot fire, turning occasionally, until well browned and cooked through, 35 to 40 minutes. 
            (Cover the grill for a smokier flavor.) Transfer the chicken to a platter and serve.</li>
