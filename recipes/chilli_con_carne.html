        </ul>

        <h2>Time to cook up a storm!</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large casserole or heavy-based pan over a medium heat. Add a glug of oil and once hot add the onion. 
                Cook for a minute and add the carrots. Cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the onions are softened and translucent. 
                Add the garlic and cook for a further 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the spices and the oregano and cook for two minutes, or until aromatic. 
                Add the beef, breaking it up as it fries into small pieces. Cook for 3-4 minutes, 
                or until brown all over and broken down into small pieces. Stir in the tomato purée and cook for two minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the kidney beans and chopped pepper, stirring over the heat for 3-4 minutes to soften the pepper a little, 
                then add the tomatoes and enough beef stock to slightly more than cover the meat. 
                Stir everything round, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to unstick any bits from the bottom, 
                and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Bring to a rapid simmer, reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook for 1½-2 hours, or until thickened and rich. 
                If at any point the liquid level looks low then add a little hot water or any remaining stock.</li>
            <li>Before serving, add the grated squares of chocolate and stir through the hot chilli con carne to melt. 
                Taste and season with salt and pepper as necessary.</li>
            <li>Serve with rice and garnish the chilli with coriander and soured cream.</li>
        </ol>
